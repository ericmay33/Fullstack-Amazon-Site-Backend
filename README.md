To run this backend server:
1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run start`

It should start up on port 3000.
You can test the server by running any of the test files while the server is running.
For example, `npx tsx test/getProducts.ts` will call out to the `/products` endpoint and print the result (if successful).
